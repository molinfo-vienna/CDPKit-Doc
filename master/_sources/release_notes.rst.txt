Release V1.1.1
--------------

.. rubric:: Improvements
            
- Significantly improved the generation of 2D coordinates for macrocyclic structures

.. rubric:: Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the generation of conformers under application of a fixed substructure template where the generated
  conformers sometimes displayed the mirror image of the specified 3D template structure

  used the already reserved letter **p** as shortcut for the option *--fixed-substr-min-atoms*. The new shortcut is **~**
   
.. rubric:: Miscellaneous Changes

Release V1.1.0
--------------

.. rubric:: New Functionality and Features

  (the new default mode) for generating only the chemically most reasonable tautomers
- New option in class *Chem::TautomerGenerator* that allows to suppress the output of generated tautomers
  which represent just a different resonance structure of a previously reported tautomeric form
- New :doc:`structgen </applications/structgen>` feature that allows to enforce a particular 3D structure for defined parts of the input molecules
- New :doc:`confgen </applications/confgen>` feature that allows to specify substructures of the input molecules that
  shall adopt a particular conformation which is then kept 'fixed' during conformer generation
  (more information and examples can be found :ref:`here <confgen_notes_v1_1>`)
- Conformer generator settings now allow to specify rotatable bond count dependent values for RMSD threshold, energy window and
  max. output ensemble size

  which enforces that a database molecule matched by multiple query pharmacophores is saved only once to the output hit list
- New Python example script for database preparation
- New Python example script demonstrating how the torsion driving functionality can be used for conformer sampling
- The visual molecule and reaction data inspection tool :doc:`ChOX </applications/chox>` now allows to display atom and bond configuration labels

.. rubric:: Improvements

- Overhaul of the tautomer generation code for increased efficiency and flexibility
- The output conformer ensemble compilation process now strives for higher energetic diversity among the picked conformers which, on average,
  leads to higher accuracy in the reproduction of experimental structures (benchmarking results can be found :ref:`here <confgen_notes_v1_1>`)

  under some circumstances
- Documentation updates and corrections

  the accounting procedure to regard the meaning of generic atom types (e.g. any halogen)
- New utility functions *Chem::calcBasicProperties()* for a more comfortable initialization of *Chem::MolecularGraph*
  and *Chem::Reaction instances* for further processing
- Code in class *GRAIL::GRAILDescriptorCalculator* now calculates a shorter GRAIL descriptor (35 elements) with
  not further subdivided H-bond donor/acceptor feature types
