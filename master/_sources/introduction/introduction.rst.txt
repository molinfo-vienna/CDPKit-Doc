About
-----

The *Chemical Data Processing Toolkit* (CDPKit) is an open-source cheminformatics software toolkit implemented in C++. In addition to the C++ API a Python-interfacing layer is provided that allows to use all of CDPKit's functionality from Python scripts.
CDPKit features a high-quality and well-tested modular implementation of basic functionality typically required by any higher-level software application in the field of cheminformatics. 
This includes data structures for the representation and analysis of chemical structures and reactions, routines for the I/O of small molecule, macromolecular and reaction data in different file formats (MDL Mol, SDF, Rxn, RDF, Mol2, PDB, MMTF, SMILES, SMARTS, etc.), functionality for ring and aromaticity perception, pharmacophore generation, substructure searching, max. common substructure searching, molecular fingerprinting, molecule fragment generation (RECAP :cite:`doi:10.1021/ci970429i`, BRICS :cite:`https://doi.org/10.1002/cmdc.200800178`), 2D structure layout and visualization, 3D structure and conformer generation :cite:`doi:10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00563`, physicochemical property prediction, and so on.

At its core, CDPKit provides a set of command line tools and software libraries (CDPL) that enable researchers to work with molecular data in a systematic and efficient manner, allow a seamless integration with other software and databases, and to develop their own C++ or Python cheminformatics software applications.

CDPKit integrates especially well with machine learning and data mining libraries, enabling scientists to build predictive models for various molecular 
properties. This makes it a valuable toolkit for developing software in the field of computational drug discovery, where machine learning is employed to predict the biological activity, toxicity, 
and other properties of potential drug candidates. An integration example can be found in the source code of the software described in :cite:t:`molecules26206185`.
